Here is a repo where i'm learning pygame.
It is a way to have fun with python.

##1-Shoot em up

This is my very first project.
Difficulties are to understand how we build a 2D game, even if i use a module as pygame.

We have to pay attention on the grid compare to the screen, the few event as the keyboard action and so on.

##2-Plateform

this a second project where i try to think of the gameplay with a fewer freedom and responsibilties.
Every step has to be think of by myside in order to progress in learning either with Python nor in the game world.

###a-Zelda-like.

What is Zelda type of game ?
Is there any other example of that kind ?
What is interesting in that game play ?
What could i keep in mind to create my own game ?
